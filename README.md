# jQueryProject

I am displaying information about my progress in the online coding development platform CodeSchool using AJAX requests and jQuery and for the CSS I am using Bootstrap and Flexbox as well as custom styles.

Feel free to fork this project to use with your own CodeSchool progress, just make sure to change the relevant data to your own.
